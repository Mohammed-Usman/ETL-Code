1. Pyspark was not working properly in windows, had to use linux instead, windows was unable to locate JDBC ".jar" file.
2. Was unable understand Apache Spark Env properly, so used Pyspark lib in linux.
3. Was not sure how to use Posgres DDL in PySpark
4. Installed postgres -> successsfully connected to PySpark -> later found out, can only perform read and write (no Update/Upsert).
5. Created Managed Table but still having issue in mergin old and new data.
